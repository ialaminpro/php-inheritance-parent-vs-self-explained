### **Understanding the Use of `parent::` vs. `self::` in PHP Inheritance**

#### **Question:**
In the following PHP code, why is `parent::getWebsiteName()` used instead of `self::getWebsiteName()`?

```php
<?php
class domain {
  protected static function getWebsiteName() {
    return "W3Schools.com";
  }
}

class domainW3 extends domain {
  public $websiteName;
  public function __construct() {
    $this->websiteName = parent::getWebsiteName();
  }
}

$domainW3 = new domainW3;
echo $domainW3->websiteName;
?>
```

#### **Answer:**

In object-oriented PHP, both `parent::` and `self::` can be used to call static methods from a class. However, they behave differently when inheritance is involved. Here's a breakdown of why `parent::` is used in this example:

### **The Difference Between `parent::` and `self::`:**

- **`parent::`**: 
  - Refers to the **parent class's** method or property.
  - When used, it ensures that the method or property in the **superclass** (parent class) is called, even if a subclass (child class) overrides it.

- **`self::`**: 
  - Refers to the method or property in the **class where it is currently being called**.
  - It doesn’t account for inheritance or any subclass behavior. If the method is overridden in the subclass, `self::` will call the overridden method.

### **Why `parent::getWebsiteName()` is Used:**

In the code, `parent::getWebsiteName()` is used in the constructor of the `domainW3` class to explicitly call the method from the parent class (`domain`). This is done for several reasons:

1. **Calling the Parent Class’s Method**:
   - `parent::getWebsiteName()` ensures that the method from the parent class (`domain`) is invoked, regardless of whether it gets overridden in the child class (`domainW3`).

2. **Preventing Unintended Overrides**:
   - If the `getWebsiteName()` method is ever overridden in the child class (`domainW3`), using `parent::` guarantees that the original method from `domain` is still called, preserving the intended behavior.
   
   For example, if `domainW3` had its own version of `getWebsiteName()`, `parent::` would still call the parent’s version, while `self::` would call the overridden method in the child class.

3. **Ensuring Correct Behavior in Inheritance**:
   - When you want to reference a method that should not change regardless of overrides, you use `parent::`. This is particularly useful when subclass methods are meant to extend but not replace the behavior of the parent class.

### **What Would Happen if `self::` Were Used Instead?**

If you used `self::getWebsiteName()` in the `domainW3` constructor instead of `parent::`, the behavior would be different:

- In the current scenario, since `domainW3` does not override `getWebsiteName()`, using `self::` would still work and produce the same output.
  
- However, if the `getWebsiteName()` method were overridden in the `domainW3` class, using `self::` would call the **child class’s** version of the method instead of the parent’s.

### **Example of Why `parent::` is Necessary**:

Consider the following example where `getWebsiteName()` is overridden in `domainW3`:

```php
class domain {
  protected static function getWebsiteName() {
    return "W3Schools.com";
  }
}

class domainW3 extends domain {
  protected static function getWebsiteName() {
    return "OverriddenWebsite.com";
  }

  public $websiteName;
  public function __construct() {
    $this->websiteName = parent::getWebsiteName();
  }
}

$domainW3 = new domainW3;
echo $domainW3->websiteName; // Output: W3Schools.com
```

In this case, `parent::getWebsiteName()` ensures that the method from `domain` is called, even though `getWebsiteName()` is overridden in `domainW3`. If `self::getWebsiteName()` were used instead, the output would be `"OverriddenWebsite.com"` because `self::` would call the overridden method in `domainW3`.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Use `parent::`** when you want to ensure that you are calling a method or accessing a property from the **parent class**, regardless of whether it is overridden in the child class.
  
- **Use `self::`** when you want to reference the method or property in the **current class** where the code is executed. Be cautious, as it may call an overridden method if the method exists in the subclass.

In the given code, `parent::getWebsiteName()` is used to ensure that the `getWebsiteName()` method from the `domain` class is always called, even if it is overridden in a subclass. This is useful in scenarios where you want to preserve the behavior of the parent class, even when extending it.
